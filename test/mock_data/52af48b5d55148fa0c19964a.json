I will be forwarding to you Monday, a briefing package \nthat will provide Mr. Lay with background on the proposed transaction, the \nclient and client representatives.   Please let Lety Smith, who is my \nadministrative support (ext 36562) know if Mr. Lay will need it sooner.   \nLety will page me in the field to make alternative arrangements.\n\nMichael Mann\n\n\n\nKenneth Lay@ENRON on 08/09/2000 02:24:39 PM\nSent by: Rosalee Fleming@ENRON\nTo: Michael Mann/HOU/EES@EES\ncc:  \nSubject: Re: Owens-Illinois Meeting  \n\nMichael, in case you need Ken's bio, I am attaching it for your use.\n\nRosalee\n\n\n\n\n\tEnron Energy Services\n\t\n\tFrom:  Michael Mann @ EES                           08/08/2000 09:12 PM\n\tPhone No: 609.252.0907\n\t\n\n\n\nTo: Thomas E White/HOU/EES@EES, Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron\ncc: Harold G Buchanan/HOU/EES, Lou Pai, Jeremy Blachman, Mark Peterson, Julie \nDavidson/HOU/EES, Judy G Smith/HOU/EES@EES \nSubject: Owens-Illinois Meeting\n\nWe have confirmed a meeting to introduce you to Tom Young, EVP (and member, \nO-I Board of Directors) and members of his management team at O-I \nHeadquarters next Tuesday, 8/15 at 11:30 am.  We have 90 minutes, Mr. Young \nwill be hosting us to lunch during our meeting.  Joe Lemieux, CEO, is \nunavailable only because his calendar just didn't match up with your near \nterm available dates.  My strong bias is that the sooner we have an \nopportunity to connect at the top the better, especially given our drive to \nclose in Q-3.\n\nIn addition to coordinating logistics, I will get briefing packets to your \noffices Monday describing the proposed transaction, deal related issues \n(details are not likely to come up during the meeting), key O-I personnel \nbios, and general information about O-I and its current business, including \nsummary outside financial analysis.\n\nRegards,\nMichael\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
