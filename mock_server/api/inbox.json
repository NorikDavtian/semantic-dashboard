    "text": "Ken,\n\nAttached is the agenda for Enron's upcoming Management Conference.  I've \nreceived valuable input from numerous members of Enron's management team and \nthis is the result.  While it is quite a departure from the traditional \nconference agenda, I think it will prove to be engaging and \nthought-provoking.  I'll look forward to your input.\n\nIf you are comfortable with the agenda, I'd like to send a copy of it to the \nExecutive Committee accompanied by a memo from the Office of the Chairman \nexplaining the goals and objectives for the conference.  It is important that \nsenior management understand the change in format and their role, if any, on \nthe agenda.  (I recognize that some executives look forward to presenting at \nthis conference and their absence from the agenda may be an issue for them.)\n\nI am working with some talented people to create a slide template for all \npresenters.

    "text": "I wanted to provide you an update on where we stand related to several recent \ncontribution requests.\n\nTom Delay's Request -- We did fulfill the $10,000 request that came to us \nfrom Tom and Christine Delay for the Fort Bend Child Advocates.  In addition, \nwe've arranged with Heather for your family's foundation to match Enron's \ngift.  I spoke directly with Christine Delay several times and they are very \nappreciative of the gifts and our efforts to correct the initial oversight.\n\nYMCA --  I've had multiple conversations with Heather about a combined \nEnron/Lay Family contribution to the YMCA.  According to Heather, you and \nLinda have agreed to contribute $500,000 and ask that Enron match.  We are, \nof course, willing to do that.  I am scheduling a meeting with Bill Phillips \nof the YMCA to discuss the gift.  We will be talking to him about naming \nopportunities as well as the YMCA's consideration of extending services to \nEnron employees at the downtown YMCA, as well as outlying facilities.  (FYI:  \nThe downtown YMCA recently chose to cancel the agreement we'd had with them \nallowing Body Shop members to utilize the facility.)\n\nOther Capital Campaigns -- We are currently evaluating several other capital \ncontribution requests.  Each is outlined below.  We are proceeding in several \nways.  First, I am scheduling a meeting with Marty Sunde to discuss EES's \ninterest in pursuing energy service agreements with these not-for-profit \ninstitutions.  As you know, EES is focusing its current efforts on much \nlarger scale energy portfolios.  Secondly, I am working to evaluate these \nrequests based on the leveraging opportunities associated with each.  \nFinally, we want to be equitable in our giving to these local campaigns as \nwell as consistent in our giving philosophy.  We are working to balance these \nrequests relative to each other and to our goal to transfer dollars away from \nmulti-year gifts toward programs.\n\nTexas Heart Institute -- I had breakfast yesterday with Bob Devlin, Dr. \nDenton Cooley, Jack Doherty and Meredith Long.  They shared with me plans for \na new Texas Heart Institute building in the Medical Center.  (The building \nwill bear a striking resemblance to our buildings -- oval in shape and bluish \nglass.)  They are conducting a $75 million campaign -- $42 million to build \nand equip the building and $33 million to sustain programs in research and \neducation.  They are requesting $1 million from Enron and will allow us to \nspecify how the gift is spent.  American General and Shell Oil Foundation \nhave each contributed $1 million\n\nBaylor College of Medicine -- Amy Lee and I had lunch last week with several \nfolks from Baylor.  They are in the midst of a campaign to fund their many \nprograms in research and education.  We discussed opportunities to expand our \nexisting medical-based literacy program - Prescription for Reading.  They \nalso outlined for us numerous other sponsorship opportunities.  No specific \ndollar amount was requested.  While several pharmaceutical companies have \ncontributed in the $500,000 to $1 million range, most of our local peers are \nwithin the $100,000 to $500,000 range.\n\nUniversity of Houston - MD Anderson Library and the Honors College -- As you \nknow, the University is requesting $500,000 from Enron over 5 years to \nsupport renovation of the library.  Since our call with Harriet Latimer, I've \nconducted some research to determine what other local corporations are \ncontributing.  Currently, no companies have made a financial commitment.  In \nfact, only Compaq and Shell have committed at all with in-kind \ncontributions.  While I am confident that we will support this in some way, I \nam particularly interested in speaking with Steve Barth and Chet Gladchuck at \nthe University to determine if the library could be rolled into the energy \nservices agreement we are currently evaluating with the University's athletic \ndepartment.\n\nOn a separate note, you'd forwarded to me a request from the University to \nfund a publication \"The Future of International Education:  Directions & \nOpportunities.\"  Elyse Kalmans discussed this with her contacts at U of H.  \nThey indicated that this was not a high priority for them and would rather \nhave Enron commit its resources to other University endeavors, such as the \nlibrary.  We have chosen to decline this request.\n\nI apologize for the length of this memo.  However, I did want to keep you \nupdated on the status of these various requests.  I will present \nrecommendations to you on each of these pending requests in the coming \nweeks.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or comments, please \ncontact me. \n",

    "text": "I wanted to provide you an update on where we stand related to several recent \ncontribution requests.\n\nTom Delay's Request -- We did fulfill the $10,000 request that came to us \nfrom Tom and Christine Delay for the Fort Bend Child Advocates.  In addition, \nwe've arranged with Heather for your family's foundation to match Enron's \ngift.  I spoke directly with Christine Delay several times and they are very \nappreciative of the gifts and our efforts to correct the initial oversight.\n\nYMCA --  I've had multiple conversations with Heather about a combined \nEnron/Lay Family contribution to the YMCA.  According to Heather, you and \nLinda have agreed to contribute $500,000 and ask that Enron match.  We are, \nof course, willing to do that.  I am scheduling a meeting with Bill Phillips \nof the YMCA to discuss the gift.  We will be talking to him about naming \nopportunities as well as the YMCA's consideration of extending services to \nEnron employees at the downtown YMCA, as well as outlying facilities.  (FYI:  \nThe downtown YMCA recently chose to cancel the agreement we'd had with them \nallowing Body Shop members to utilize the facility.)\n\nOther Capital Campaigns -- We are currently evaluating several other capital \ncontribution requests.  Each is outlined below.  We are proceeding in several \nways.  First, I am scheduling a meeting with Marty Sunde to discuss EES's \ninterest in pursuing energy service agreements with these not-for-profit \ninstitutions.  As you know, EES is focusing its current efforts on much \nlarger scale energy portfolios.  Secondly, I am working to evaluate these \nrequests based on the leveraging opportunities associated with each.  \nFinally, we want to be equitable in our giving to these local campaigns as \nwell as consistent in our giving philosophy.  We are working to balance these \nrequests relative to each other and to our goal to transfer dollars away from \nmulti-year gifts toward programs.\n\nTexas Heart Institute -- I had breakfast yesterday with Bob Devlin, Dr. \nDenton Cooley, Jack Doherty and Meredith Long.  They shared with me plans for \na new Texas Heart Institute building in the Medical Center.  (The building \nwill bear a striking resemblance to our buildings -- oval in shape and bluish \nglass.)  They are conducting a $75 million campaign -- $42 million to build \nand equip the building and $33 million to sustain programs in research and \neducation.  They are requesting $1 million from Enron and will allow us to \nspecify how the gift is spent.  American General and Shell Oil Foundation \nhave each contributed $1 million\n\nBaylor College of Medicine -- Amy Lee and I had lunch last week with several \nfolks from Baylor.  They are in the midst of a campaign to fund their many \nprograms in research and education.  We discussed opportunities to expand our \nexisting medical-based literacy program - Prescription for Reading.  They \nalso outlined for us numerous other sponsorship opportunities.  No specific \ndollar amount was requested.  While several pharmaceutical companies have \ncontributed in the $500,000 to $1 million range, most of our local peers are \nwithin the $100,000 to $500,000 range.\n\nUniversity of Houston - MD Anderson Library and the Honors College -- As you \nknow, the University is requesting $500,000 from Enron over 5 years to \nsupport renovation of the library.

The OPIC \nauthorization bill was passed by a big margin, the Defense Appropriation bill \ngiving the President authority to extend the exemptions on India sanctions, \nsuccess with the Trade Adjustment Act language important to a problem raised \n\"recently\" by PGE, good news on Cong. Barton's willingness to consider some \npositive language in the electricity restructuring bill, etc. Yesterday, \nSudaker Rao called me from the Indian Embassy to read me a letter Ambassador \nChandra wrote to Dean O'Hair , chair of the US-India Business Council \nthanking them and Enron by name for the success on the sanctions effort. Our \nUS WTO Energy Services Coalition grew to 40 members and next week we lead the \nUS-Bolivia Business Partnership on its trip to Bolivia to meet with President \nBanzer and others in the Bolivian political and business leadership. \n\nAt Enron, Ken frequently cites the Enron people who involve themselves in \nmaking things happen. I think the items cited above are examples of what Ken \nsays to all of us. Ken and Rosalee are always ready to get involved as they \ndid in moving the position letter signed by Ken in the OPIC issue. My group \ndid the preparation of the letter and moved it to the Hill in a timely \nfashion. John Hardy working from material prepared by Kelly Kimberly on the \nCuiba update (the House International Relations Committee senior staff was \nworried that it could be used to support some adverse amendment) preped the \nstaff and drafted a one-pager answer sheet. This over-all effort on the OPIC \nissue was repeated on all of the other matters assigned.\n\nIt is very rewarding to be part of an organization that constantly works to \nwin. Ken's right; people do make the difference at Enron. Thanks to all.\n\nJoe\n\n\nLora Sullivan\n10/13/99 06:27 PM\n\n\nTo: Joe Allen/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rob Bradley/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Andrew S \nFastow/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bill Gathmann/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, John \nHardy/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Brian \nRedmond/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chris Long/Corp/Enron@Enron, Joseph W \nSutton/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Terence H \nThorn/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Dennis Ulak/EOG/Enron@Enron, Joe \nHillings/Corp/Enron@Enron, Cynthia Sandherr/Corp/Enron@Enron, Jeffrey \nKeeler/Corp/Enron@Enron, Scott Reblitz/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, \nMarc Eichmann/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Jay \nSparling/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Carolyn \nCooney/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Lora Sullivan/Corp/Enron@Enron\ncc:  \nSubject: OPIC Reauthorization -- Passed in House 10/13/99\n\nThe House just passed a four-year reauthorization of OPIC.

The OPIC \nauthorization bill was passed by a big margin, the Defense Appropriation bill \ngiving the President authority to extend the exemptions on India sanctions, \nsuccess with the Trade Adjustment Act language important to a problem raised \n\"recently\" by PGE, good news on Cong. Barton's willingness to consider some \npositive language in the electricity restructuring bill, etc. Yesterday, \nSudaker Rao called me from the Indian Embassy to read me a letter Ambassador \nChandra wrote to Dean O'Hair , chair of the US-India Business Council \nthanking them and Enron by name for the success on the sanctions effort. Our \nUS WTO Energy Services Coalition grew to 40 members and next week we lead the \nUS-Bolivia Business Partnership on its trip to Bolivia to meet with President \nBanzer and others in the Bolivian political and business leadership. \n\nAt Enron, Ken frequently cites the Enron people who involve themselves in \nmaking things happen. I think the items cited above are examples of what Ken \nsays to all of us. Ken and Rosalee are always ready to get involved as they \ndid in moving the position letter signed by Ken in the OPIC issue. My group \ndid the preparation of the letter and moved it to the Hill in a timely \nfashion. John Hardy working from material prepared by Kelly Kimberly on the \nCuiba update (the House International Relations Committee senior staff was \nworried that it could be used to support some adverse amendment) preped the \nstaff and drafted a one-pager answer sheet. This over-all effort on the OPIC \nissue was repeated on all of the other matters assigned.\n\nIt is very rewarding to be part of an organization that constantly works to \nwin. Ken's right; people do make the difference at Enron. Thanks to all.\n\nJoe\n\n\nLora Sullivan\n10/13/99 06:27 PM\n\n\nTo: Joe Allen/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rob Bradley/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Andrew S \nFastow/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bill Gathmann/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, John \nHardy/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Brian \nRedmond/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chris Long/Corp/Enron@Enron, Joseph W \nSutton/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Terence H \nThorn/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Dennis Ulak/EOG/Enron@Enron, Joe \nHillings/Corp/Enron@Enron, Cynthia Sandherr/Corp/Enron@Enron, Jeffrey \nKeeler/Corp/Enron@Enron, Scott Reblitz/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, \nMarc Eichmann/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Jay \nSparling/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Carolyn \nCooney/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Lora Sullivan/Corp/Enron@Enron\ncc:  \nSubject: OPIC Reauthorization -- Passed in House 10/13/99\n\nThe House just passed a four-year reauthorization of OPIC.  Some amendments \nwere passed, however, none of them were \"killers\" for Enron interests.  The \nbill will now go to conference and we hope to have final legislation in the \nimmediate future.\n\nMore information to follow.
